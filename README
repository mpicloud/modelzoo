This repository contains a variety of ONNX models used to test ML systems in the MPI-SWS Cloud Software Systems Research Group.

Primarily we include the following:

- Source ONNX models (or other source if they come from elsewhere)
- Appropriate scripts (python, c++, whatever else) for compiling the model from source to platform-specific (e.g. TVM)
- The compiled model binaries

Our initial experiments are primarily focusing on ONNX as a source format for models, and TVM as the compiler, with NVidia GPUs as the compilation target.
